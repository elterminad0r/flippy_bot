# flippy\_bot
Flippy bit bot. It uses and was developed with the webdriver for Chromium. You
will need to install the correct drivers for your browser if you want to run
this. Change the browser at your own risk - I couldn't get firefox to work.

The constants defined at the start may need to be tweaked to suit your
preference. I've also found that sometimes it starts spawning enemies at a
ridiculous rate. I've yet to figure out why this is. I suspect it may be either
due to flippy bit scaling enemy spawn rate with user input rate leading to a
runaway exponential, or some anti-cheating mechanism. Another viable
explanation is of course a gaping bug in my code.
